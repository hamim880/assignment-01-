        <h1 class="yh">My Inspiration</h1>
        <p>My inspiration is Jabir ibn Hayyan,Who really was Jabir ibn Hayyan? Known in Europe as Geber, this Islamic scholar of the Middle Ages is considered the father of alchemy and one of the founders or pioneers of pharmacology and modern chemistry. His figure and even his name are shrouded in mist and uncertainty, which fuel his myth. Legend attributes to him the authorship of between 300 and more than 1000 works on philosophy, alchemy and chemistry. However, doubts and controversy arise from the first two (known) biographical references to him, dating from as early as the 10th century.</p>
